This is my first public github project.
Its a simple collection of HTML documents containing meal recipes that I "borrowed" from the internet.

Im simply following along the Odin Project and this is the first actual project in the course!

By "borrowed" I mean copied, Since as of writing this Readme file I cannot cook...
